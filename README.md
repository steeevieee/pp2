Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that need to be fixed, but I don't have the time to do it...
* handle when the clocks change
* pull more that description and episode number from the details page
* allow parameters to be passed in
* offset days
* handle a `configure` parameter so that the config file can be generated
* make it all work inside the XMLTV framework
* find out if the subtitle does exist somewhere, as I've not found it yet
